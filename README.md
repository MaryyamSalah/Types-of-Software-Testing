# Types-of-Software-Testing
 Understanding the various types of software testing is essential for developers and quality assurance professionals alike.

 Different Types of Software Testing
 1. Manual testing is a technique to test the software that is carried out using the functions and features of an application. In manual software testing, a tester carries out tests on the software by following a set of predefined test cases.
 
Advantages of Manual Testing
Fast and accurate visual feedback: It detects almost every bug in the software application and is used to test the dynamically changing GUI designs like layout, text, etc.
Less expensive: It is less expensive as it does not require any high-level skill or a specific type of tool.
No coding is required: No programming knowledge is required while using the black box testing method. It is easy to learn for the new testers.
Efficient for unplanned changes: Manual testing is suitable in case of unplanned changes to the application, as it can be adopted easily.


2. Automation Testing
Automated Testing is a technique where the Tester writes scripts on their own and uses suitable Software or Automation Tool to test the software. It is an Automation Process of a Manual Process. It allows for executing repetitive tasks without the intervention of a Manual Tester.

Advantages of Automation Testing:
Simplifies Test Case Execution: Automation testing can be left virtually unattended and thus it allows monitoring of the results at the end of the process. Thus, simplifying the overall test execution and increasing the efficiency of the application.
Improves Reliability of Tests: Automation testing ensures that there is equal focus on all the areas of the testing, thus ensuring the best quality end product.
Increases amount of test coverage: Using automation testing, more test cases can be created and executed for the application under test. Thus, resulting in higher test coverage and the detection of more bugs. This allows for the testing of more complex applications and more features can be tested.
Minimizing Human Interaction: In automation testing, everything is automated from test case creation to execution thus there are no changes for human error due to neglect. This reduces the necessity for fixing glitches in the post-release phase.


Types of Manual Testing

1. White box testing techniques analyze the internal structures the used data structures, internal design, code structure, and the working of the software rather than just the functionality as in black box testing. It is also called glass box testing clear box testing or structural testing. White Box Testing is also known as transparent testing or open box testing.

Advantages of White box Testing:
Thorough Testing : White box testing is thorough as the entire code and structures are tested.
Code Optimization: It results in the optimization of code removing errors and helps in removing extra lines of code.
Early Detection of Defects: It can start at an earlier stage as it doesn’t require any interface as in the case of black box testing.
Integration with SDLC: White box testing can be easily started in the Software Development Life Cycle.
Detection of Complex Defects: Testers can identify defects that cannot be detected through other testing techniques.


2. Black-box testing is a type of software testing in which the tester is not concerned with the internal knowledge or implementation details of the software but rather focuses on validating the functionality based on the provided specifications or requirements.


Advantages of Black Box Testing:
The tester does not need to have more functional knowledge or programming skills to implement the Black Box Testing.
It is efficient for implementing the tests in the larger system.
Tests are executed from the user’s or client’s point of view.
Test cases are easily reproducible.
It is used to find the ambiguity and contradictions in the functional specifications.


3. Gray Box Testing is a software testing technique that is a combination of the Black Box Testing technique and the White Box Testing technique.


Advantages of Gray Box Testing:
Clarity of goals: Users and developers have clear goals while doing testing.
Done from a user perspective: Gray box testing is mostly done from the user perspective.
High programming skills not required: Testers are not required to have high programming skills for this testing.
Non-intrusive: Gray box testing is non-intrusive.
Improved product quality: Overall quality of the product is improved.
